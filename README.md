# 3D L-System Plant Simulation

🌳 **[Live Demo](https://kryphus.github.io/3d-lsystem-simulation/)** 🌳

An interactive 3D procedural plant growth simulation using Three.js and L-Systems.

## Features

- 🌳 **Procedural L-System trees** with multiple plant types
- 🌱 **Growth animation** - watch trees grow from the ground up
- 💨 **Wind simulation** - realistic swaying
- 🌿 **Forest undergrowth** - bushes and grass pop in after main tree
- 🏝️ **Floating island** with low-poly aesthetic

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Kryphus/3d-lsystem-simulation.git

# Open with any local server
npx http-server . -p 3000

# Open browser to http://localhost:3000
```

## Controls

- 🌱 **Grow** - Generate new tree
- 🔄 **Reset** - Clear all plants
- 💨 **Wind** - Adjust wind strength
- ⚙️ **Complexity** - Tree detail level (1-5)
- 🌳 **Type** - Change plant type

## Tech Stack

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- L-Systems for procedural generation
- Vanilla JS/HTML/CSS
